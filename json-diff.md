* Transform JSON to string, so we could set the point to how to find a common subsequence of two sequences. 
    * How to transform JSON to string - `JSON.stringify`
    * How to resolve circular references problems?
    * For convenient, it's advanced to add a `\n` before `}` and after `{` - for example: `JSON.stringify({ key:1 }, null, '  ')`
    * And `String.split` to split it into several rows so that we could find the difference in each row
